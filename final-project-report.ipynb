    "# Analysis on Impact of Crime on Rental and Housing Prices in Chicago\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Safety has been considered a fundamental human right since the beginning of the beginning of the human rights era. Maintaining Law and Order is one the most basic and important responsibilities of any local government. Crime rate thus becomes a very important indicator for comparing neighborhoods. One of the most studied effects of crime is the impact it has on the housing and rental rates in any communities. One of the easiest ways to measure crime is to explore the housing and rental rates in a given area. The goal of this project is to study the relationship betweeen crime rate and housing prices in Chicago city and the to discover patterns in the types of crimes that effect housing prices more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Previous Work\n",
    "My inspiration for this analysis is based on the work done by Harold Li that can be found on [Databucket](https://databuckets.org/databucket/2016/01/exploring-chicago-crime-and-housing.html). The analysis for this research was based on Trulia API data. The results from his work showed that crime rates inversely impact housing rates and there is a non-linear relationship between them. To add to this analysis, I would like to also see if different crime types have different effects on the housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions & Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    " - Is there a strong relationship between crime rates and housing prices in Chicago at the neighborhood level? Are changes in  crime rates a strong predictor for changes in housing prices?  \n",
    "     - For this I will perform a linear regression (housing price ~ crime rate) to understand the relationship between the crime rates and housing prices. This would involve trying different models (ridge, lasso,, etc.) and finding any non-linear relationships (log-linear, etc.)\n",
    "     - The $R^2$ value would determine whether changes in crime rates are a strong predictor for housing prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " - Do different crimes have different effects on the housing prices?  \n",
    "     - For this analysis I plan to fit a linear regression (huosing price ~ crime rate + crime type) to see whether there is a substantial difference between the coefficients of different crime types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "For this project I have used four different datasets to create data for my analysis. I used the [Zillow Dataset](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) to get the housing prices for neighborhoods in Chicago. For crime I used the Chicago Crimes dataset that is publically available on [the official website of the City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie) under the following [Terms of Use](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html). In order to normalize the crime counts based on the neighborhood poplulations, I used the 2010 Census data for the population at neighborhood level. The data is available from the [Datahub website](https://datahub.cmap.illinois.gov/dataset/community-data-snapshots-raw-data/resource/8c4e096e-c90c-4bef-9cf1-9028d094296e?inner_span=True). Finally for mapping the latitude-longitude coordinates in the crime dataset to Zillow defined neighborhoods, I used the nieghborhood boundary data generated in the [github repository](https://github.com/mashvisor/us-neighborhoods-boundaries/blob/master/out/csv/IL-Regions.csv).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Unknowns\n",
    "Since the different crime types are unequally distributed, studying the effect of different crime rates on the housing prices may not have very clear results. For eg, Crimes that are not so common (eg:-HUMAN TRAFFICKING, PUBLIC INDECENCY) may not occur in multiple neighborhoods. In this case there would be fewer data points and thus the regression may be skewed. To handle this I plan to filter out crime types with fewer data points."
