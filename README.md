# Analysis on Impact of Crime on Rental and Housing Prices in Chicago

### Motivation
Safety has been considered a fundamental human right since the beginning of the beginning of the human rights era. Maintaining Law and Order is one the most basic and important responsibilities of any local government. Crime rate thus becomes a very important indicator for comparing neighborhoods. One of the most studied effects of crime is the impact it has on the housing and rental rates in any communities. One of the easiest ways to measure crime is to explore the housing and rental rates in a given area. The goal of this project is to study the relationship betweeen crime rate and housing prices in Chicago city (known for Law and Order!) and the to discover patterns in the types of crimes that effect housing prices more than others.

### Dataset
For this project I plan to use two different datasets to prepare data for my analysis. I plan to use the [Zillow Dataset](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) to get the housing prices for neighborhoods in Chicago. For crime I plan to use the Chicago Crimes dataset that is freely available for use on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime) under the [CC0 Licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). I will also use [Craig M. Booth's github code](https://github.com/craigmbooth/chicago_neighborhood_finder/tree/739deff8f9f349720299b193b4259aa690876e52) to map the latitude-longitude data to the neighborhoods in the housing dataset. 

### Unknowns
The creation of the dataset is inspired from a similar analysis performed by Harold Li that can be found on [github](https://github.com/haroldmli/01-Chicago-Crime-Rates-and-Housing-Prices). Since the original sources of data used for this analysis are no longer available, I will be substituting data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-crime). While combining the two data sources, there may be mismatches between the neighborhoods in the two datasets which may lead to problems in creating the data.
